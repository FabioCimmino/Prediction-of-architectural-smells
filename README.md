# Prediction-of-architectural-smells

Architectural smells are symptoms of bad code or design that can cause
different quality problems, such as faults, technical debt, or difficulties
with maintenance and evolution. Thus, it is very important to be able to
understand how they evolved in the past and to predict their future evolution.
In this project we propose a different machine learning models which predict
architectural smells based on dependency features.
The work is divided into two parts: in the first part we analyzed a single
version of 60 projects at the class and package level; in the second part we
analyzed 10 versions of 10 projects at the class level.
All the analysis steps were implemented on the KNIME Analytics platform.

For all details please read the pdf "Prediction of architectural smells".
